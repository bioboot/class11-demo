## Bio3D Class 11

Read some PDB files and do some analysis

```{r}
library(bio3d)

# Download some example PDB files 
ids <- c("1TND_B","1AGR_A","1TAG_A","1GG2_A","1KJY_A","4G5Q_A")
files <- get.pdb(ids, split = TRUE)
```

Lets align these structures with the `pdbaln()` function.

```{r}
# Extract and align the chains we are interested in  
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)
pdbs
```

Sequence analysis
```{r}
# Calculate sequence 
identity  seqidentity(pdbs)
identity
```
